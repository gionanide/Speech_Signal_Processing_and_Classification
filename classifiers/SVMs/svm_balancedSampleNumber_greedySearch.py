that we start this procedure from a very large field and then we tried to focues to the direction where the results

the best value was 1000 so then we tried [100, 1000, 10000, 100000] and so on in order to focues to the area which give us
the best results. This function is in comments because we found the best parameters and we dont need to run it in every trial.'''
